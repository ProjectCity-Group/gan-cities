## **Snazzy Map Data Scraper Guide**
It's really as simple as installing external libraries, and then running addressgen.py


#### **Make sure you set the directory where you want the photos to be saved**
Within addressgen.py there is a variable titled "default_path_location" and is currently configured to save
in "C:/Users/Public/Pictures/". You should probably consider reassigning this variable to a directory that has more space.
The example I provide is ``CDW_file_location = E:/Map Photos/Attempt2/``, where `E:/` is my spare hard drive.
